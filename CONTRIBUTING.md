## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it by opening an issue on GitHub. Include as much detail as possible:
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- Expected and actual behavior.
- Screenshots if applicable.
- Any other information that might help us understand the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements. To suggest an enhancement, please open an issue on GitHub and include:
- A clear description of the suggested enhancement.
- Why you believe this enhancement would be useful.
- Any relevant examples or mockups.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Follow the project's code style.
- Include tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- Consider the security impacts of your changes

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cvs-health/langfair.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd langfair`
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (using `venv` or `conda`)
4. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
5. Install our pre-commit hooks to ensure code style compliance: `pre-commit install`
6. Run tests to ensure everything is working: `pre-commit run --all-files`

You're ready to develop!

### Development tasks

Update the Bandit baseline: `poetry run bandit -r . -f json -o bandit_baseline.json`
Run bandit checks: `poetry run bandit -r . -b bandit_baseline.json`
Run all Ruff checks: `poetry run ruff check`

**For documentation contributions**
Our documentation lives on the gh-pages branch and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

There are two relevant directories:
* `docs_src` - where source documentation files are located
* `docs` - where the built documentation that is shown on GitHub Pages lives.

To build documentation:
1. Checkout the `gh-pages` branch
2. Navigate to the source dir: `cd docs_src`
3. Build documentation for a GitHub Pages deployment: `make github`

## Style Guides

### Code Style

- We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) to lint and format our files and run security checks.
- Our pre-commit hook will run all `ruff` checks when you commit.
- You can manually run Ruff at any time (see [Ruff usage](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#usage)).

Please ensure your code is properly formatted and linted before committing.
